# Power-BI 
Ecommerce sales Dashboard 📊🛍️🔍🎨🔧👨‍💻

With this dashboard, I was able to track and analyze online sales data with ease, using complex parameters to drill down in worksheets and customization using filters and slicers. 🤓

I also created connections, joined new tables, and performed calculations to manipulate the data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations. 💻💪

To provide a comprehensive view of the data, I utilized various types of customized visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts and slicers. 📈🌟
